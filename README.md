# Project_19
# JD 2200: Lidar scan that allows you to view and test out different objects in various lidar view scenes.
## v0.2.0
### Features: Configured and connected the app to the fire base and we added cloud storage to the fire base project and created the navigation bar and recreated the dynamic set list view using swift storyboards.
### Bug Fixes: Fixed the set list view as it wasnâ€™t working how we wanted it to in sprint 1. We were unable to integrate the storyboard features with the ARView so looking into React Native as an alternate solution.
